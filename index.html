        Larry Page and the Creation of PageRank
        <br />
        <div style="text-align: left">Recently, Google co-founder Larry Page created the PageRank algorithm. This algorithm was a way to organize the world wide web based on how different websites are related to each other through links. Through this method, the algorithm groveled through the internet and ranked the importance websites. To find out more from this story, we have an insider getting exclusive information from none other than Larry Page.</div>
        <div class="part">
          <div class="q"><span class="subject">Interviewer</span>: I see in 2004, you received the Marconi Prize for your accomplishment of PageRank, now considered Google’s best known search-algorithm, now I must ask you, why did you and Brin create this powerful search engine? <span class="arrow">&darr;</span></div>
          <div class="a"><span class="subject">Page</span>: Brin and I both had a common goal, and that was to organize the world’s information, and make it accessible to users. Before Google, Brin and I started a research project named “BackRub” which analyzed the web to find out which web pages linked to other web pages. PageRank ultimately was derived from that research project. Later, PageRank was used as the foundation for Google.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="part">
          <div class="q"><span class="subject">Interviewer</span>: It is definitely evident that you excel in your field of computer science, can you tell us your background of your interest of computer science? <span class="arrow">&darr;</span></div>
          <div class="a"><span class="subject">Page</span>: I was born and raised in Michigan, where my father obtained a PhD in computer science from the university of Michigan. From there, I suppose I have just inherited the interest from my father; he has taught me a lot of what I know.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="part">
          <div class="q"><span class="subject">Interviewer</span>:  Ah, your father definitely did have an impact on your life I see. You say that you were born and raised in Michigan, how did that impact where you attended school. And ultimately, what made you decide to go out of state to Stanford? <span class="arrow">&darr;</span></div>
          <div class="a"><span class="subject">Page</span>: Almost all of my education I earned in my home state of Michigan. I attended, and eventually graduated from East Lansing High School. From there I immediately attended University of Michigan where I received my Bachelor’s Degree of Computer Science. I decided to pursue my education even further, and I decided to attend graduate school at Stanford. Good thing I did, because I would have not have met Sergey, and thus Google would cease to exist in this world today.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="part">
          <div class="q"><span class="subject">Interviewer</span>: Thank you for your time today. PageRank has proven to be the backbone of Google today, and I will say the world is thankful for that, is there anything else you would like to add? <span class="arrow">&darr;</span></div>
          <div class="a"><span class="subject">Page</span>: Yes, thank you. I would say that we created PageRank, and ultimately the company of Google itself for embodying the entrepreneurial spirit, and lending momentum to the creation of new businesses.</div>
